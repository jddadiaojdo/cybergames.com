GTA V full version is set in the year 2013, in Los Santos city and the surrounding areas. This revolves around the stories of its three protagonists, namely Trevor Philips, Franklin Clinton and Michael De Santa. This happens about 5 years following the events of GTA 4 and four years later after events of GTA: Chinatown Wars. Being among the most awaited video game titles released in year 2013, this game was highly anticipated before its release. The game was released to a universal acclaim, with scores of 96 and above on GameRankings and MetaCritic . It also garnered perfect scores from more than 30 reviewers. The game was able to sell 11.21 million copies, grossing $800 million on the first day. It also set a lot of records and eventually, this made $1 billion in just 3 days following the release of the game. What’s New in the Gameplay? It evolves almost all mechanics found in the earlier GTA games. When it comes to driving, the vehicles also saw a remarkable improvement as Rockstar decided to run more complicated physics on them. Cars also hold to the ground a bit better. Mechanics of driving feel more similar to a racing game, specifically the Midnight Club series as compared to the boat-like and rocky handling system of GTA 4.
Mechanics in shooting are also better as far as the feel is concerned and are also bigger than the game’s melee mechanics. However, it doesn’t mean that you can’t have fun with the melee combat as this has been improved too from the earlier titles. When you download GTA 5, you will see that there are also changes with the weapon selection. Instead of the old method of choosing through weapons, a Weapon Wheel is added. This game draws inspiration from most of the earlier Rockstar titles such as Midnight Club, Red Dead Redemption, Manhunt and Max Payne 3.
